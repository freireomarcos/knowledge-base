This repository is a **central hub for all the topics Iâ€™m studying** and exploring.
My goal is to consolidate notes, examples, and insights in a single place for **personal reference, review, and continuous learning**.

Over time, this repository will grow to cover a variety of subjects, including:

* **SQL Server** (indexes, queries, execution plans, ACID, and more)
* **C#** (core features, new language features, best practices)
* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
* **Software Architecture**
* And many other technologies, patterns, and concepts I encounter on my learning journey.

I intend for these notes to be **practical, example-driven, and easy to consult**, so I can quickly revisit and reinforce key concepts.

Feel free to browse, use ideas, and learn along with me.
This is a **work in progress**, so expect updates regularly as I deepen my understanding.
