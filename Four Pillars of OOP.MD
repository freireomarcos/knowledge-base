# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the principle that allows classes derived from the same base class to define methods with the same signature but different behaviors.
It makes the code more flexible and easier to extend.

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the idea of hiding an object’s internal state and exposing it only through well-defined public methods.
It protects data and keeps the code modular and maintainable.

# Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of focusing on what’s essential while hiding unnecessary complexity.
It simplifies how we interact with objects by showing only what’s relevant.

# Inheritance

Inheritance is the principle that allows a class to reuse and extend the behavior of another class.
It promotes code reuse, establishes clear relationships between classes, and helps build more structured and maintainable systems.
